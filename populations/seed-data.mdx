title: 'Seed Data'
description: "Understand how a Population's input data are used by the Simulation Engine to make predictions."

Importantly, a Population's seed data do not represent all of the information which Semilattice uses to make predictions about the target population. Most of the information comes from the Large Language Model (LLM) used by the [Simulation Engine](/simulation-engines/introduction), with the seed data effectively selecting the relevant information from the LLM.
